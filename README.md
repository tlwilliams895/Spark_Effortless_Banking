Project Overview – Spark Effortless Banking

For my course project, I would like to complete and present a project that will integrate many of the topics that I’ve learn throughout the course. The project will consist of two parts: a Java application that will allow users to login to view deposit and withdrawal habits and a website that documents the functionality of the application.

I decided to create this project after recently closing on my new home while learning of the importance of financial responsibility and money management. By tracking financial management of earned and unearned income, users will be able to know and follow a trail of responsible spending habits, prevent overspending, and self-educate on healthy financial patterns.

The Java Application (Features)

The Java application will be a simple banking application where I will have a basic GUI and text-based code additions that will implement new GUI features. The application will present the user with a some options and collect input from the user to execute certain tasks like depositing or withdrawing money.

User Account/Login: Users will be able to create an account and personalized profile
Account View: Users will be to view their account history, deposits and withdrawals, and expenses
Expense Tracker: Users will be able to track expenses and maintain positive account balance
View Expense History: Users will be able to view total deposit and withdrawal history
The Documentation Website

The second part of the project will be a website that documents the features of the banking application. This documentation will be presented as a user manual, which instructs a user how to interact with the application.

Project Presentation

My project presentation will focus on the following:

Allowable and user-friendly behaviors of my app: Deposits, Withdrawals, etc.
Documentation of behaviors – deposits, withdrawals, transfers, expense tracking, etc.
Ways utilized to protect my application from improper use
